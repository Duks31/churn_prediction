# Churn Prediction

Churn prediction is the process of identifying customers who are likely to stop using a company's products or services. It is particularly important in subscription-based businesses, telecommunications, banking, and other industries where retaining customers is crucial for long-term success.

## Project Overview

In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict customer churn using customer data. We will explore the data, preprocess it, build a predictive model, and evaluate its performance.

### Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

```bash

```

### Data overview

The dataset contains customer information from a bank, which is used to predict whether a customer will churn (leave the bank) or not. The dataset has 10,000 total entries and 14 columns which includes the following:

- RowNumber: The row number in the dataset.
- CustomerId: A unique identifier for each customer.
- Surname: The surname of the customer.
- CreditScore: The credit score of the customer.
- Geography: The country of residence of the customer (e.g., France, Spain, Germany).
- Gender: The gender of the customer (Male, Female).
- Age: The age of the customer.
- Tenure: The number of years the customer has been with the bank.
- Balance: The account balance of the customer.
- NumOfProducts: The number of products the customer has with the bank.
- HasCrCard: Whether the customer has a credit card (1) or not (0).
- IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active member (1) or not (0).
- EstimatedSalary: The estimated salary of the customer.
- Exited: Whether the customer has churned (1) or not (0).

### Requirements

- graphviz
- joblib
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- seaborn
- xgboost

### Running the project

To run the project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Clone the repo. You can install the required packages by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing the required packages, you can run the Jupyter notebook `churn_prediction.ipynb` to explore the data, preprocess it, build a predictive model, and evaluate its performance.

## Data preparation

### Data preprocessing

The data was cleaned and preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (Geography, Gender, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember), and scaling numerical features (CreditScore, EstimatedSalary, Balance, Age).

### Feature selection

Features were selected based on their importance and relevance to predicting churn. The following features were used: CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary.

## Modeling

### Model Training

Two models were trained: Decision Tree and XGBoost. These models were chosen for their ability to handle complex relationships and provide feature importance insights. The models were trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data.

XGBoost confusion matrix:

#### Training and Testing Accuracy

- Decision Tree: Training Accuracy: 82.9%, Testing Accuracy: 83.6%
- XGBoost: Training Accuracy: 100%, Testing Accuracy: 87%

The XGBoost model outperformed the Decision Tree model in terms of testing accuracy, making it the preferred model for predicting customer churn.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameters for the XGBoost model were tuned using RandomizedSearchCV to find the best combination of parameters for optimal performance.

```bash
{'min_child_weight': 3,
 'max_depth': 8,
 'learning_rate': 0.05,
 'gamma': 0.1,
 'colsample_bytree': 0.4}
```

### Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and other metrics to assess their performance. The confusion matrix for the **BEST** XGBoost model is shown below:

### Predictions

#### Predicting Unseen Data
The model was used to predict unseen data. The same preprocessing steps were applied to the new data before making predictions.

#### Output Interpretation
The output includes churn predictions and probabilities, saved in `Churn_prediction_output.csv`.

### Power BI visualization

A Power BI report was created to visualize the data and model predictions. The report includes visualizations of customer churn, feature importance, and model predictions. The report can be found in the `vizualizations` folder, `churn_BI.pbix`, and a screenshot is shown below:
